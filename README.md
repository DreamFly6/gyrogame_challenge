# GyroGame

Swift Core Motion Game Challenge

A very small game where a user should control a ball on the screen with motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, etc). 

Like there is a ball on the screen and the point where it should go. 

The speed should be proportional to the degree the device is turned.

Extra:
- [x] Code documentation 
- [x] Code validation - (Unit) test cases
